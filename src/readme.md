Emily and Manolo were sitting in the park. They have seen each other there a few times before. Manolo looked at Emily and said, “Hi Emily!”. “Oh, hello Manolo!” she replied. “It is nice to meet you”, said Manolo.
“It is nice to meet you too, Manolo. How are you today?”
“I am good, thank you! How are you?”
“Great thanks. How old are you, Manolo?” – Emily asked – “I am 21 years old. How old are you?”
